# Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This Sales Analysis project leverages Python for data preprocessing, SQL for querying data from a SQL Server database, and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to analyze sales data to gain insights into key performance metrics such as total sales, profit margins, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Project Components

1. *Python Preprocessing*:
    - Load and clean the raw sales data using Python.
    - Handle missing values, data type conversion, and feature engineering.
    - Output the cleaned dataset for further analysis or database storage.

2. *SQL Querying*:
    - Connect to a *SQL Server Management Studio* database using Python.
    - Query the cleaned sales data from the SQL database for detailed analysis.
    - Perform aggregation, filtering, and joining operations using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

3. *Power BI Visualization*:
    - Import the queried data into Power BI.
    - Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics such as sales performance by region, product category, customer demographics, and sales trends over time.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes related to sales transactions. Common features may include:
- *Order ID*: Unique identifier for each sales order
- *Customer ID*: Unique identifier for each customer
- *Product ID*: Unique identifier for each product sold
- *Quantity*: Number of units sold
- *Unit Price*: Price per unit of product
- *Total Sales*: Calculated field representing the total revenue from each order
- *Order Date*: Date when the order was placed
- *Region*: Geographic region where the sale occurred

## Project Workflow

1. *Data Preprocessing in Python*:
    - Load the raw sales data using pandas.
    - Handle missing or duplicate data, and ensure correct data types for each feature.
    - Perform feature engineering (e.g., calculating total sales, profit margins).
    - Export the cleaned data to a CSV file or directly into a SQL Server database.

2. *SQL Querying*:
    - Connect to the SQL Server database using Pythonâ€™s pyodbc or SQLAlchemy libraries.
    - Execute SQL queries to:
        - Aggregate sales data by region, product, and time.
        - Perform customer segmentation analysis.
        - Identify top-selling products and low-performing ones.
        - Calculate sales trends over different time periods.
    - Example SQL query to fetch sales by product:
    sql
    SELECT ProductID, SUM(TotalSales) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY ProductID
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
    

3. *Visualization with Power BI*:
    - Import data from the SQL Server or CSV into Power BI.
    - Create the following visualizations:
        - *Total Sales by Region*: A bar chart showing sales performance across different regions.
        - *Top 10 Products by Sales*: A ranked list of top-performing products.
        - *Monthly Sales Trends*: A line chart depicting sales growth or decline over time.
        - *Profit Margin Analysis*: A matrix or table comparing profit margins by product category.
    - Build interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore the data.

## Requirements

- *Python 3.x*
- *Libraries*:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - pyodbc or SQLAlchemy
    - matplotlib (optional for local visualizations)
- *SQL Server Management Studio*
- *Power BI Desktop*

## Setup

### Python Setup:

1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-analysis.git
    

2. Install the required dependencies:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. Run the preprocessing script:
    bash
    python data_preprocessing.py
    

### SQL Connection Setup:

1. Install the required ODBC driver for SQL Server.
2. Set up the SQL connection string in the Python script:
    python
    import pyodbc

    conn = pyodbc.connect(
        'DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};'
        'SERVER=server_name;'
        'DATABASE=database_name;'
        'UID=username;'
        'PWD=password'
    )
    

3. Run the SQL querying script:
    bash
    python sql_queries.py
    

### Power BI Setup:

1. Open *Power BI Desktop*.
2. Import data from SQL Server or the cleaned CSV file.
3. Create and publish your dashboards and reports.

## Results

- *Insights*: The project will provide detailed insights into sales performance, product trends, customer behavior, and profitability across different regions and time periods.
- *Dashboards*: Interactive Power BI dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders for real-time insights.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how to integrate Python, SQL, and Power BI for effective sales data analysis. The combination of preprocessing, querying, and visualization provides actionable insights into sales performance, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
